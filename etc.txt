Questions:
1) Must 'mobile' field be required in registration form?
2) There is a task "This Mobile number should appear in contact (res.partner) screen".
But it presents there by default. Maybe, you would like to place it on any other location?
3) Should 'honestus code' be required in case of 'default code' presents or vice versa?
4) There is a task "In "Product" column, Honestus Code should be printed instead of Default Code".
But it doesn't present in report

Answer to Task 5:
I would propose to split this task and process it by pieces. 
When a particular task is completed, it saves the temporary result and the next one begins.
This process will be repeated until the entire file has been processed.
